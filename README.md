# flutter_numpad_widget

A set of Flutter widgets providing numpad input functionality without the soft keyboard.



## Getting Started

In your Flutter project add the dependency:

```
dependencies:
    ...
    flutter_numpad_widget: 0.0.1
```

## Usage Example
Import ```flutter_numpad_widget```
```
import 'package:flutter_numpad_widget/flutter_numpad_widget.dart'
```
### Numpad Only

You can use the Numpad widget without it's associated text widget or formatting.

In this scenario, you just create a NumpadController and pass it to your Numpad.
The controller will send a notification when its contents have changed.
